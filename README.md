## Notes
* Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.
* Custom hooks let us move repetitive or complex code out of our components
* Pulls "logic" out of your component not "visuals"
* You can think of Custom hooks as "helper functions" for React
* Custom hooks usually use other React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc)
* Normal helper functions cannot use Hooks. Only Custom Hooks can do that
* React Rule: React Hooks must start with the prefix "use"
* Multiple instances of the same custom hook do not share state
* A Custom Hook can return anything you want (value, array, object, function)
